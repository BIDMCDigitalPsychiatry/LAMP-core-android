 * A specific sub-detail of a `ActivityEvent` that contains specific  interaction information that comprises the parent `ActivityEvent`.

 * @param value The value of the item that was interacted with; in most games,  this field is  `null`, but in a survey, this field is the question  choice index.
 * @param type The type of interaction that for this detail; for example, in  a Jewels game,  `none` if the tapped jewel was  incorrect, or `correct` if it was correct, or in  a  survey, this field will be `null`.
 * @param duration The time difference from the previous detail or the  start of the parent result.
